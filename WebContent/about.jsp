  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this website is connecting DIU’s  students and teacher's/consultant
easily for student’s counselling and without any kind of trouble students can easily find
 out about their consultant’s necessary counselling information and their required
 counselling filed. In recent years depression and anxiety have afflicted undergrad
  students at alarming rate. They are not clear about their goal and how will they work 
  on their goal and many students are terribly depressed what will they do? Though  DIU 
  have enough experienced consultant but maximum students even don’t know the consultant’s 
  name or time of counselling and room number as well as their counselling field and for knowing
   all this they have to go physically many times to the department and this is certainly a tiresome work
    and because of their idleness they don’t do this. </p>
  <p>Our website “DIU Student Counselling” aims at that from anywhere students can get their  consultant’s
   all necessary information and if they don’t know about their problem they can also find that out by just
    fill –up a given form which will analyze  in which field they need counselling and which consultant they
    need the information will be shown when they just go to the web application.This certainly is not time 
   consuming and will help student to easily connected with the teacher and solve their problem.
